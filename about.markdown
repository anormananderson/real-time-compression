This is a project site from the University of Victoria's Fall 2023 offering of CSC 461. My project explored real-time compression, and eventually narrowed to focus on polygon meshes.

This site is a record of my progress along the way, and includes:

- [Biweekly project updates]({{ site.baseurl }})
- [A demo video]({{ site.baseurl }}/update/2023/12/05/demo.html)
- [An end-of-term final report]({{ site.baseurl }}/report/2023/12/11/report.html)
