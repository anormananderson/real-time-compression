# real-time-compression

## What is real-time-compression?

This is a project site from the University of Victoria's Fall 2023 offering of CSC 461. My project explored real-time compression, and eventually narrowed to focus on polygon meshes.

This site is a record of my progress along the way, and includes:

- [Biweekly project updates](https://anormananderson.github.io/real-time-compression)
- [A demo video](https://youtu.be/8Caw7d_83wE)
- [An end-of-term final report](https://anormananderson.github.io/real-time-compression/report/2023/12/12/report.html)

## How to use

Currently, the easiest way to view the site is at its URL on the web, (anormananderson.github.io/real-time-compression).

[Instructions on how to locally run the Jupyter Notebook used in my demo video are available here.](https://anormananderson.github.io/real-time-compression/update/2023/12/15/update.html)
